Perfect! 🎉 Since your backend build was successful, the next step is to run the backend and then the frontend, so you can see the chat application in action.

Here’s what to do next:

Step 1: Run the Backend

In the same project folder (where pom.xml is located), run:

mvnd spring-boot:run


Wait for it to start. You should see logs like:

Started ChatApplication in X seconds


The backend is now running on:

http://localhost:8080


This is your Spring Boot server that handles WebSocket connections and API calls.

Step 2: Run the Frontend (React)

Open a new CMD window.

Navigate to the frontend folder (if your repo has a frontend folder):

cd C:\Users\marap\Desktop\jfs\spring-boot-websocket-chat-demo-master\frontend


Install dependencies (only needed the first time):

npm install


Start the React frontend:

npm start


By default, it will open a browser at:

http://localhost:3000


The frontend connects to your backend at http://localhost:8080 automatically.

Step 3: Test the Application

Open multiple browser windows or tabs to simulate different users.

Try sending messages — one-to-one and group chat.

Check online indicators if the app supports them.

✅ Summary
mvnd clean compile

mvnd spring-boot:run → backend running on 8080

npm start → frontend running on 3000

Chat application should now be fully functional without Docker.

If you want, I can also guide you to configure the frontend and backend to work on the same port to avoid CORS issues, which makes it easier to run the app smoothly.
